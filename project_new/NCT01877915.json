Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rivaroxaban or placebo (each in addition to standard of care for heart failure and coronary artery disease as prescribed by their managing physician). The study will consist of a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and a follow-up after the sponsor-announced global treatment end date (GTED, defined as the date when 1200 primary efficacy outcome events are predicted to have occurred). The double-blind treatment phase is estimated to last for 6 to 54 months. Participants will discontinue study drug after taking both their morning and evening doses on the GTED and will return to the study center for the end-of-study visit (between 15 and 45 days but no sooner than 15 days after the GTED). Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. The average study duration for participants is expected to be approximately 29 months.
